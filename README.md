m&m shell

Features:
	Forks and executes commands!
	Parses multiple commands on one line!
	Redirects using >, <!
	Guaranteed to regrow hair!
	Can summon a winged unicorn for fast & magical transit!

Attempted:
	The following did not end up working, but have been left in the code, commented out.
	Could not get pipes to work
	Tried to implement >>, but it kept overwriting the file
	Looked at replacing ~/ with home directory, got seg faults
	Was unable to have the "puppy" command produce a puppy and eject it from the optical drive.

Bugs:
	Putting two ;'s next to each other will break the parser
	Redirecting to a file that does not exist occasionally does not work.
	Hair regrowth function may result in a seg fault.
	Occasionally, the unicorn command will fail, opening a great chasm in the earth and summoning the demon Beelzebub, who will proceeded to unleash his wrath and begin his reign of terror.

	If delim does not appear, 1 is returned
	====================*/

	/*======== char ** parse_line() ==========
	Inputs:  char *line 
	Returns: Array of strings where each entry is a token 
	separated by delim

	If line contains multiple tokens separated by delim, this 
	function will put each token into an array of strings

	/*======== char * trim() ==========
